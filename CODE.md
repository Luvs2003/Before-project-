> **This guide explains what each code file does in simple, everyday language - no programming knowledge required!**

## 🎯 What is Code?

Think of code like a **recipe book** for computers. Just like a recipe tells you step-by-step how to make a dish, code tells the computer step-by-step what to do. Our RoboAdvisor Pro has 5 main "recipe files" that work together to create your investment portfolio.

## 🎓 Key Takeaways for Non-Coders

### ✅ **What You Should Understand:**

1. **Each file has a specific job** - like different departments in a company
2. **They all work together** - like a team collaborating on a project
3. **The code follows logical steps** - like following a recipe
4. **Everything is automated** - once set up, it runs by itself
5. **Safety is built-in** - compliance checking happens automatically

### 🚀 **Why This Matters:**

- **Transparency**: You can see exactly what the system does
- **Trust**: Understanding builds confidence in the recommendations
- **Control**: You know what data is collected and how it's used
- **Learning**: You understand the investment process better

## 🤔 Common Questions from Non-Coders

### Q: "Is my data safe?"
**A:** Yes! The code only stores your information temporarily while you use the app. It's like writing on a whiteboard that gets erased when you leave.

### Q: "Can the AI make mistakes?"
**A:** The AI follows programmed rules and market data, but like any tool, it's not perfect. That's why we have compliance checking and you always have final approval.

### Q: "Do I need to understand code to use this?"
**A:** Not at all! The code runs in the background. You only interact with the user-friendly interface (like using a smartphone without knowing how it works inside).

### Q: "What if something goes wrong?"
**A:** The system has multiple safety checks built-in, like having several locks on your door. Plus, everything follows SEBI regulations for your protection.
