## 💻 Technical Implementation

### 🎯 **Key Algorithms I Developed**

#### **1. Risk Score Calculation**
```python
# Simple explanation of the algorithm:
def calculate_risk_score(user_answers):
    total_score = 0
    
    # Each answer gets points (1-5)
    for question, answer in user_answers.items():
        points = get_points_for_answer(answer)
        total_score += points
    
    # Convert to percentage (0-100%)
    risk_percentage = (total_score / maximum_possible_score) * 100
    
    # Categorize the user
    if risk_percentage <= 35:
        return "Conservative" # Safe investor
    elif risk_percentage <= 65:
        return "Moderate"    # Balanced investor
    else:
        return "Aggressive"  # Risk-taking investor
```

#### **2. Portfolio Allocation Algorithm**
```python
# How I decide investment percentages:
def create_portfolio_allocation(risk_level):
    if risk_level == "Conservative":
        return {
            "Debt Funds": 60%,      # Safe government bonds
            "Large Cap Equity": 25%, # Big company stocks
            "Gold ETF": 10%,        # Gold for safety
            "International": 5%      # Foreign investments
        }
    elif risk_level == "Moderate":
        return {
            "Large Cap Equity": 35%, # Big company stocks
            "Debt Funds": 35%,      # Government bonds
            "Mid Cap Equity": 15%,   # Medium company stocks
            "Gold ETF": 10%,        # Gold for safety
            "International": 5%      # Foreign investments
        }
    else: # Aggressive
        return {
            "Large Cap Equity": 50%, # Big company stocks
            "Mid Cap Equity": 25%,   # Medium company stocks
            "Small Cap Equity": 15%, # Small company stocks
            "Debt Funds": 5%,       # Minimal safe investments
            "Gold ETF": 3%,         # Small gold allocation
            "International": 2%      # Foreign investments
        }
```

#### **3. AI Rebalancing Logic**
```python
# How AI decides when to rebalance:
def should_rebalance(current_allocation, target_allocation):
    for asset_class in current_allocation:
        current_percent = current_allocation[asset_class]
        target_percent = target_allocation[asset_class]
        
        # If difference is more than 5%, rebalance needed
        drift = abs(current_percent - target_percent)
        if drift > 5:
            return True, f"Rebalance needed for {asset_class}"
    
    return False, "Portfolio is balanced"
```

### 🔒 **Security & Data Protection**
